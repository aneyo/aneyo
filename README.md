## About project names
You may have noticed that *most* ~~if not all~~ of my projects happen to be named after anime characters. The thing is - project naming requires some sort of creativity. I mean yeah, choosing the name even from an already existing character requires it too, but still, this is easier than just thinking up a new name that *seemingly* will suit the project well.  
Other reason - I like to characterize my projects, like, thinking about it as something close to me rather than thinking about it as another coding project.  
Also, it just a good thing to *worship* your beloved characters, without crazy stuff.
